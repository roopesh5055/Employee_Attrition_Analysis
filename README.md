# Employee Attrition Analysis
This project is to analyze the employee attrition in an organization.
This dataset contains the details of the employees who are present in the company, and the employees who left the company. The details includes the demographic, survey, and rating information.
My motive is to identify the areas with higher attrition rate. And also identify the potential reasons for the attrition.

Tableau is used for the data analysis.
